A better way to view YouTube videos on WordPress! Create the look and feel of a movie theater for your audience!

== Description ==

The Procure Eminence Theater allows your viewers to focus their attention by fading out the background and making the current YouTube video the central object. All videos will be listed in one place for convenience and each video loads asynchronously, meaning there are no more page refreshes. Since videos don't load until they're clicked on, the initial load time per page will be reduced when compared to the same page using YouTube's embed code. Please refer to the list below for other key features and benefits.

*   Animated opening and closing of the Procure Eminence Theater.

*   Autoplay - Play videos as soon as they load.
*   Suggested YouTube videos - Show suggested videos when the current video finishes.
*   HTTPS - Encryption of data to prevent "Mixed Content" warnings on HTTPS enabled websites.
